# Backend Algorithms Toolkit

A comprehensive collection of production-ready algorithms and data structures specifically designed for backend engineering challenges. This repository demonstrates practical implementations of algorithms used in real-world backend systems, from microservices architecture to data processing pipelines. Each implementation addresses real production challenges with optimized, well-documented code that can be directly integrated into backend systems. All implementations are primarily in **Python** for maximum accessibility and backend relevance.

## Repository Structure

Each algorithm or algorithm family is organized in its own folder under `algorithms/`, with a dedicated README for usage, details, and examples. This structure ensures clear separation of concerns, scalability, and ease of contribution.

Naming conventions:

- **Folders:** kebab-case (e.g., `graph-algorithms`)
- **Files:** snake_case (e.g., `sorting_algorithms.py`)

``` bash

```

## Algorithm Categories

- Graph & Network Analysis (e.g., Dijkstra, Tarjan, criticality analysis)
- Data Processing & Sorting (e.g., External Merge Sort, QuickSelect)
- Distributed Systems (e.g., Consistent Hashing, Leader Election)
- Caching Strategies (e.g., LRU/LFU with TTL)
- Rate Limiting (e.g., Token Bucket, Sliding Window)
- Database Optimization (e.g., B-trees, query optimizers)
- Security (e.g., cryptographic primitives)
- Monitoring & Anomaly Detection

See each algorithm folder for details, usage, and examples.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidOgalo/backend-algorithms-toolkit.git
cd backend-algorithms-toolkit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. Browse the `algorithms/` directory for the algorithm you need.
2. Read the folder's README for usage, API, and examples.
3. Integrate the Python code into your backend project or use as a reference.
4. Run or test as described in each folder.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To keep the toolkit high quality and relevant:

1. Ensure real-world backend relevance
2. Provide production-quality Python code (tests, docs, error handling)
3. Optimize for backend performance
4. Include clear usage examples
5. Add or update the algorithm's README
