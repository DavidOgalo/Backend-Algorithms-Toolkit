# Data Structures: Binary Search Tree & Hash Table

Reusable, efficient data structures for backend and algorithmic use. These may be imported as modules in other algorithms.

## Structures Included

- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Hash Table

## Use Cases

- Fast lookups and inserts
- Underlying modules for other algorithms (e.g., caching, searching)

## Usage

See `binary_search_tree.py` and `hash_table.py` for implementation and usage examples.
