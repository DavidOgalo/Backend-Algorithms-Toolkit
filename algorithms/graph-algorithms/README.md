# Graph Algorithms for Network Analysis

This module provides production-ready graph algorithms tailored for backend network analysis, such as microservices routing, dependency analysis, and infrastructure planning.

## Algorithms Included

- Dijkstra's Algorithm (shortest path)
- Tarjan's Strongly Connected Components
- Criticality Analysis

## Use Cases

- Optimize API call paths between services
- Detect circular dependencies and service clusters
- Identify single points of failure in infrastructure

## Usage

See `graph_algorithms.py` for implementation and usage examples.
